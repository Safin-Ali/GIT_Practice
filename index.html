                    <h2>Samsung M53</h2>
                    <h3>Price <strong>5,999TK</strong> </h3>
                    <p>The Galaxy M53 5G now sits at the top of Samsung's M series, which now spans a wide range of
                        prices. Samsung's latest smartphone boasts of some interesting hardware such as a 120Hz Super
                        AMOLED display, a MediaTek Dimensity 900 SoC with vapour cooling, and a 108-megapixel primary
                        camera. My first impressions of this device were positive, and it's now time to see how it fares
                        against the competition. Is it a worthy successor to the Galaxy M52 5G, and should it be your
                        first choice under Rs. 30,000? Let's find out..</p>
